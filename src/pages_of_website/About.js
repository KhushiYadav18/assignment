        <p className="para">Our key objective is to nurture and strengthen the Institute’s bond with its alumni community, business corporations and philanthropists. These groups are the key stakeholders in IIT Bombay’s journey of excellence. We encourage the involvement and participation of these entities in the Institute’s strategic initiatives. These include setting up world class research and academics in emerging areas of science and technology, building world class infrastructure, improving faculty value proposition, strengthening the entrepreneurship ecosystem, and contributing to the society.</p>
        <p className="para">SARC also uses the Dean ACR newsletter (AKA Knowledge Tree) to update alumni about the various student activities at IITB and apprise them of the latest research being conducted by the institute.

By executing alumni-driven initiatives for the benefit of students and assisting the Alumni Association (AA) in organizing various reunions, SARC bridges the gap between the Institute and its alumni. It also gives the volunteers of SARC an insight into the world of the alumni.</p>
